# React-Jobly
About: Jobly is a mock app that allows users to view companies and apply to jobs posted by those companies. The app features a full user signup/login process as well as authorization/authentication using JSON web token and bcrypt. The styling is done using ReactStrap and Bootstrap. Animations are used to various places to enhance the user experience as well as give feedback on loading. The backend is built in Node/Express and the frontend is built in React. PostgreSQL is the database that is used. Unit and integrations tests are written using jest. Feel free to install locally and run or go to the live site hosted on heroku: [jobly](https://react-jobly.herokuapp.com/)
